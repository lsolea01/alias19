The 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Human Mobility Computing and Privacy
             (HuMoComP 2015), collocated with the
16th IEEE Intl. Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM 2015)
                    
      June 15, 2015, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

AIMS & TOPICS OF INTEREST:

This  is the  third of a successful series of workshops that aims to
act as a bridge between human mobility, privacy, security and mobile 
data management.

Human mobility computing aims to acquire more insights about human daily life,
including the activities, behaviors, habits, preferences and lifestyles by
integrating a variety of heterogeneous data sources and by applying a range of
techniques in multiple disciplines. In the past few years, the data capturing
aspects of human mobility became widely available in the real world, e.g.,
mobile phone records, GPS traces of vehicles and pedestrians, ticketing logs
of public transportation, geo-tagged Web objects, as well as records from
roadside sensor networks. As a result, we have a better chance to develop
effective strategies and build intelligent systems that play critical
roles in areas like public health, traffic engineering, urban planning and
economic forecasting.

Detailed movement data does not only provide valuable information, but it 
often poses a threat to the privacy and security of users and companies, who
are behind the digital location and trajectory data. Movement data can reveal
the exact location of a user in real time to third parties, which is a 
violation of user privacy by per se. But it is not only the user location that 
is revealed by location traces; studying the movement patterns of a user can
reveal sensitive information as the location of her home, where she works, 
religious preferences and even indicate health problems. To counter privacy 
and security risks, a series of technologies for protecting user privacy and 
security have been developed including data anonymization methods, protocols 
for securely posing location based queries and cryptographic methods for 
exchanging location information in location based social networks.

The HuMoComP workshop is an integration of the workshop on Human Mobility 
Computing and the workshop on Privacy and Security for Moving Objects, 
both of which were organized for the first time during IEEE MDM 2013 in 
Milan, Italy (June 2013).

The topics of interest are related to the full spectrum of mobile data management
topics pertinent to human mobility and privacy/security, particularly:

Human Mobility Computing Topics:
* Activity and behavior mining from human mobility data
* Big-data processing of human mobility data
* Data quality and uncertainty issues study on human mobility data
* Delay-tolerant and opportunistic human mobility networks
* Discovery of human mobility patterns
* Efficient indexing and processing for large-scale trajectories
* Human mobility data compression
* Human mobility computing in the Cloud
* Human mobility testbeds
* Human mobility social and crowdsourcing applications
* Integration of heterogeneous human mobility data sources
* Intelligent POI recommendation systems
* Indoor human mobility applications and systems
* Impacts of external incidents on human mobility
* Mobility aware protocols
* Participatory sensing and wearable systems
* Platforms and applications for sensing and acquiring human mobility data
* Real-time analysis for streaming trajectory data
* Semantic annotation and tagging for human moving trajectories
* Social behavior analysis on location-based social networks
* Theoretic and/or empirical modeling of human mobility data

Privacy and Security Topics:
* Privacy-preserving analysis/mining of movement and location data
* Privacy-preserving publishing of movement and location data
* Anonymity in location-based services
* Information hiding in geospatial data
* Interdisciplinary approaches and studies for location data(e.g., law, economy, sociology, etc. )
* Privacy policies in location based social networks
* Secure and private protocols for exchanging location information
* Systems for anonymous provision of location based services
* Security and privacy metrics for location data and location based services
* Utility and quality metrics for anonymized spatial data
* Quality of service metrics for anonymous location-based services
* Surveys of attacks against location based data, services and social networks
* Experience papers from real-world privacy solutions for movement data
* Presence-based access control
* Privacy personalization based on context
* Case studies/real world applications of context-aware privacy and security

The workshop will be organized in a manner that fosters interaction and
exchange of ideas among the participants. Besides regular papers, we
will also consider vision, retrospective and work-in-progress papers
that have the potential to stimulate debate on existing solutions or
open  challenges. We additionally plan to accept a limited number of
demonstration papers where researchers and technologists will have the
opportunity to describe an innovative system or tool in the area of data
management for mobile and wireless access. We discourage the submission
of incremental papers. This year's program is also expected to feature
a keynote speech and a panel discussion on newly-emerging or controversial
topics.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper/Demo Submission:       Fri, February 27, 2015 (midnight EST)
Notification of Acceptance:  Tue, March 10, 2015
Camera-ready Version Due:    Wed, April 01, 2015
(Expected) Workshop Date:    Mon, June 15, 2015


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Manuscripts  in  the following  categories  will  be considered  for
publication in the IEEE Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International
Workshop on Human Mobility Computing:

* Regular papers  (max. 6  pages): The  submission should  describe
significant  theoretical and/or  experimental  contributions to  the
area of human mobility and mobile data management.

* Demo  papers (max.  3 pages): The  submission should describe the
architecture, implementation and usage of innovative tools or systems
that fit the context of the workshop. The presentation of demo papers
will be conducted in a designated session during the workshop (in the
form of short presentations).

All of the submissions should be in PDF format and conform to the IEEE MDM'15
proceedings format. Submitted papers must not have been published or currently
be under consideration for publication at another venue.

All of the submissions will be handled electronically. Each paper will
be  reviewed by several  members of the  program committee.
Detailed submission information will be posted on the website of the workshop.

The workshop proceedings will be published in the IEEE MDM proceedings
(volume 2) and electronic versions of the papers will be included in the
IEEE DL, DiSC'09 and DBLP.
